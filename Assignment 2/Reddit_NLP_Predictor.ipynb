In particular, I [was pushing for the `pipe(..)` proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-function-pipe-flow/issues/4#issuecomment-1179751775) as a way to support \"dynamic composition\" in a way that I didn\\'t think `|>` could really handle.

Super frustrating.\\n\\n----\\n\\nI [then proposed an extension](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/275) to `|>` where the `...` operator could \"spread\" into a pipeline step, which I intended as a way to help `|>` serve that \"dynamic composition\" use-case.\\n\\nThen I [subsequently pointed out](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/issues/275#issuecomment-1240263104) that it *could have* been a potential compromise between Hack and F#:\\n\\n    // (1) F# style pipe composition:\\n    val |> something |> another(10) |> whatever\\n    \\n    // (2) Hack + F#:\\n    val |> ...[ something, another(10), whatever ]\\n    \\n    // (3) instead of:\\n    val |> something(^) |> another(10)(^) |> whatever(^)\\n\\nThe (2) was my proposed idea, where `...` could spread an array of unary functions into a pipeline.

They tried scoping later, and then model services, but it was kinda too late and the complexity has a buy-in cost. Then the whole Angular2+ being TS means you either had to jump ship or port all your existing code.\\n\\nReact was the better option because it computes a partial view and does a diff on that only when you update state.

They ditch the [VDOM](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead) entirely.\\n\\nStill, they all follow around the design of your data exists twice (or even three times): On the page, and on an internal, component-level state (three if you try to use a model service).

We typically call that \"metaprogramming\".\\n\\nThe design of generators being such a low-level primitive, where the code in the generator is driven/controlled by the separate iterator, allows a nice abstraction (separation of concerns), where the \"driver\" that controls the iterator has almost complete control to interpret yielded values in arbitrary ways, as well as the values that are sent back in with each iterator `next(..)` call, but all *that* driving logic is neatly hidden away from the code you write inside the generator.\\n\\nOne important point: it should be noted that rarely are generators *the only way* to accomplish something. Pretty much everything I will point out below, *could* be kludged together without generators. Indeed, programmers have done this sort of stuff for decades without them. But generators are so powerful because they make tackling such tasks *much more* reasonable and straightforward in code.\\n\\n----\\n\\nI\\'ve written several libraries that build on top of the metaprogrammability of generators. In these libraries, the user of the library writes and provides a generator with a certain pattern or style of their own code, and under the covers, the library drives that generator code with extra functionality pushed on top of it.\\n\\nOne such example is implicitly applying a `Promise.race(..)` to any `await pr` style statement. [The CAF library](https://github.com/getify/CAF) does this, using generators to emulate the `async..await` style of code, but where there\\'s automatic subscription to cancelation tokens so that any of your async code is cancelable externally.\\n\\nAnother example [is the Monio library](https://github.com/getify/monio) which allows you to do do-expression style monad compositions in a familiar\\'ish imperative form (again, somewhat like `async..await` style), where under the covers the `yield`ed values are monadically chained together.\\n\\nI\\'ve written several other libraries that use generators similarly.

It gives you the option to select the algorithm you want, or to let fmincon automatically select the algorithm it thinks is best. It helps to be able to provide the function with the gradient and Hessian of your function, but not necessary. If not provided, fmincon will compute these on its own using a finite difference.

            " \"Running out of memory is normal in any model you train. Your model is going to use up a lot of memory as you are working with large channel sizes. So this is a standard error we all run into and we reduce batch sizes accordingly for the model to fit into video (or CPU/RAM) memory. This is unrelated to your real problem. Your code simply isn't reaching the real error because it cant fit all that data into memory. I would suggest keeping an eye on your video memory/vram when you hit play on your training to get an idea of whats going on memory wise.\\n\\nOn to your real issue.\\n\\nYour dataloader stacks images/scans on top of each other. With batch size of 1, none of your MRIs have to train in a stack. It doesn't matter if every piece of data has a different number of channels to the dataloader if theyre being loaded one at a time. If you want a batch size greater than 1, then the dataloader picks out (often randomly) x amount of folders (where x is the batch size) and stacks the data on top of each other. If one of the x images has a different number of channels, things dont line up in the stack and it breaks. So it seems like all your data is not all 160 channels. Maybe try to print the folder name in your dataloader code so that when it crashes you can identify what folder has the extra channels/images. Or you could do a check in your dataloader code to pause or print something if the channel size is incorrect. Another idea is to simply run through the entire dataset with a batch size of 1 and print out the channel size for each scan. You will either find that the scans are not all the same size channel as you first thought, or they are all the correct size and the problem isn't in your dataloader. If they are not the same size then either your dataloader is doing something weird (maybe appending channels from one folder into another folder because of a mistake but I don't know how this would be possible) or your data isn't as you thought it should be. \\n\\nOne thing that still doesn't make sense though is that even if you use a batch size of 1, and you skip the dataloader problem, your model still expects an input channel size of 160. It doesn't make sense then for your model to run (for more than a complete epoch) without crashing once it reaches the scan with 163 channels. Does your model actually run for multiple epochs with a batch size of 1? If it does then perhaps your dataloader has a mistake in it and is mixing channels/images between folders. Again I'm not sure how this would be possible with conventional dataloading methods.\\n\\nLastly:\\n\\n- Are you using a debugger in your coding environment? \\n\\nSo you should be able to at least print out the channel sizes when running for batch_size=1 and go from there. Just comment out your model.\"\n",

Did you do some learning rate discovery, or just pick it at random?\\n\\nWhy a batch size of 64?  For such a straightforward model, I would expect to be able to feed more data at a time, which would make convergence happen faster.\\n\\nI think there may be an issue with the way you are adding up the running loss, like it may be leaking gradients.  I think you may want to detach() the loss before adding it to the running loss, but I'm not sure.\\n\\nLastly, and this is probably not an issue since you seem to be hardcoding the number of epochs at 2, but are you shuffling the data in your dataloader?  If you have sorted data it may make convergence difficult.\\n\\nIn general though, I feel like you should expect sklearn to be faster on this as it has very specific solvers that are optimized for this problem.

            " 'Ok I\\'ll take a stab at this even though I don\\'t really have much experience with VAEs.\\n\\nA couple unrelated comments first:\\n\\n1. No need to use a hyperparameter for each term. Just 1 is enough, which controls the *relative* weights of the terms. E.g., `total_loss = recon_loss + beta*kl_loss`, since scaling the total_loss is meaningless, and less knobs to turn the better.\\n\\n2. It looks like you pasted code for the reparameterization trick inside a VAE. Essentially, to perform a reconstruction, a VAE would do `x -> encoder -> (mu, log_var) -> reparam -> z -> decoder -> x_recon`. To generate new samples though, you don\\'t need most of that. Just sample some z\\'s from the standard normal and feed it through the decoder: `return decoder(torch.randn(batch_size, latent_size))`. Your question is very reasonable though, so maybe you already understand this and pasted the wrong code or something, I dunno.\\n\\nOk so your question. I believe that technically a \"true\" VAE does not have those hyperparameters. Then, your loss term is the (negative) ELBO, which provides a lower bound to the marginal data distribution, and all is well. Introduction of the hyperparameter totally changes this (although it still may work from an optimization/regularization perspective), so I don\\'t think we can have any guarantees about the distributions we\\'ll be sampling. You\\'re sort of gradually turning the VAE into a vanilla AE, but then asking how to sample from it, when a huge part of VAEs over AEs are allowing you to sample from them.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s impossible though. Unfortunately I don\\'t have the silver bullet for you. Let me know if you find one, I find this stuff very interesting. That said, here\\'s one idea I\\'ve seen for vanilla AEs. Run a bunch of data through the encoder to get a bunch of latent space samples. Then use something like Gaussian mixture modelling to estimate the density of that latent space. Then sample from that density. I\\'ve done this in the past with very simple datasets and it works, but can\\'t speak for how good of an idea it is in general.\\n\\nAgain, take all this with a grain of salt, as I don\\'t have much experience in this part of ML.'\n",
            " 'I also use VAE (not from computer/information science though) and I tried to do the same thing: keeping reconstructions good while sampling for realistic new data. This can be done by betaVAE. As the other commenter said it is enough to use a hyperparameter for only the KLD part of loss with beta, which is the part responsible for reparameterize. But even if you balance the reconstruction and KLD loss, you need to compromise from both sides. Further improvement might be cost annealing. There are several strategies to do this, gradually increasing the beta in different ways -the optimum way must be found. What I ended up in my model is to keep beta very low for early epochs and let them model learn reconstructions then gradually increase the beta and then train the model in more epochs. To see how much the reconstruction and KLD losses are and how many epochs are necessary for them to increase/decrease, you may train and evaluate model at beta=0 and beta=1 first. Then you can try to find best steps and beta values.\\n\\n- Again, please consider I’m from a different field and trying to use these methods in my research.'\n",

I think this also contributes to the reputation as being difficult to train.  Once upon a time, deep feedforward nets were also hard to train but better initialization and hacks like batch-norm alleviate their dynamical systems problems, manifested as exploding or vanishing gradient---or both at the same time, expansion in some directions and contraction in others. \\n\\nIn particular I think the square hidden to hidden weight matrices in RNNs should be initialized close to identity (singular values/eigenvalues of the overall hidden to hidden transformation are critical to stability/trainability, ideally close to 1 so there is little chaos or dissipation).  There are some papers on guaranteeing entirely unitary hidden-to-hidden dynamics (unitary like in electromagnetism/quantum mechanics) which will preserve long time-scale behavior but those require custom weight matrix implementations, i.e. compositions of elementary rotations and not a straight forward square set of FP multiply. \\n\\nThen the biases of forget gates should be fairly high because these correspond to the timescale of typical number of iterations/past values which should inform the current state.

Tensorflow had a particularly spiky year in 2021, but they seemed to be legitimate PRs, not bots or anything like that.
